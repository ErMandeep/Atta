# Atta
(Updated Version of [PHP-Weight-Manager](https://github.com/eliareutlinger/PHP-Weight-Manager))<br/>
Atta helps you to reach your aims in weight loss for a specific date. It will do so by calculating your daily dose of calories by your current weight to achive the best results to a chosen date.

## How it works
Atta will calculate your BMI and needed calories. Based on these results and your choosen aims it'll tell you how many calories you can eat per day to get a good result. To get exact results you'll need to update your weight regulary. Your entries will be logged so you can create statistics and more.

## Requirements
 - `PHP 7.2.*` (Apache)
 - `MySQL` (InnoDB)<br/><br/>
These will come with a current Version of [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/de/index.html)

## General Installation
You can setup the App on your own or just use it [here](https://atta.eliareutlinger.ch/). In the current state, you'll only need to follow these steps for a local installation:

1. Download and Install [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/de/index.html) (Atta requires PHP7.2+ and MySQL)
2. Copy/Pull the files into XAMPP's `htdocs` directory.
4. Open the App in your browser. If configured correctly, the database should initialise itself. Otherwise, change the settings in `include/database.php` to match your database installation.
